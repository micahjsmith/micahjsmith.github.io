Last month was the [26th LIDS Student Conference](https://lidsconf.mit.edu/2021/), which was held virtually. I was happy to give a talk entitled, "A New Approach to Collaborative Data Science with the Ballet Framework," which presents some of our work from our [paper on Ballet](https://www.micahsmith.com/research/#smith2020enabling). It was great to see the creativity with which the organizers approached the virtual conference format, especially since I served in the (much easier, in retrospect) role of Conference Organizer for the [2018 conference](https://lidsconf.mit.edu/2018/).

My presentation is now up and you can watch it here:

### In memoriam

The conference was overshadowed in part by the tragic passing of my friend and classmate, Matt Brennan, who [passed unexpectedly](https://cms.math.ca/news-item/the-canadian-mathematical-society-mourns-the-loss-of-matthew-brennan/) on January 26, 2021, the night before the originally scheduled conference date. He was only 26 years old.

Matt was a good friend at MIT, who I met during EECS orientation in 2016. He was always the nicest guy in the room, with a big smile, glasses, and a flushed face. Matt was a great member of the MIT community -- not only was he kind and warm to everyone he met, but he secretly (or not so secretly, depending on your research area), was a brilliant scholar with significant advances in machine learning theory. As many others have recollected, we played quite a bit of basketball, both pick up in the MIT Z-Center and also intramural basketball on the MIT EECS team. When playing pickup, he and I were often matched up as the two "bigs". He played with a lot of grit and maximum effort at all times.

May his memory be a blessing.
