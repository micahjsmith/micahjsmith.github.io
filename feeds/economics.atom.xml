&lt;p&gt;How great are three-day weekends? For me, at least, they recall the days in undergrad in
which Thursday at 2pm was the end of the work week. The rejuvenation of those three-day
weekends is certainly a step above the normal weekend of the 21st century corporate drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only we could do something about our real-life weekends...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The proposal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, &lt;strong&gt;I propose a three-day weekend for all workers&lt;/strong&gt;. Now hang with me here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No employer would be happy to just give all of their employees Friday off each week - an
extra 52 vacation days! They might be open to weekly "flex days", with working hours
Monday-Thursday extended from 7 to 8.75 hours per day. This arrangement might be too much
for some workers but is not altogether unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two balancing incentives:
- employees' desire for longer contiguous time off
- employers' desire for a minimum amount of hours worked by employees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Though on the latter point, it is not clear that this is the best proxy for productive
output.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Micahday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose &lt;strong&gt;an eighth day of the week&lt;/strong&gt;, which we can tentatively name "Micahday."
(Alternate names are welcome.) Micahday would be inserted between Saturday and Sunday. The
key: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{4}{7}&amp;lt;\frac{5}{8}&amp;lt;\frac{5}{7}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We maintain our 5-day work week, and add a full, luxurious 3-day weekend. Fly, fool --
travel every weekend if you want to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hours worked&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume a typical US employee works 35 hours/week for 50 weeks/year for a total of 1,750 hours. (This roughly
corresponds to the actual &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t18.htm"&gt;average work
week&lt;/a&gt; of 34.5 hours and actual &lt;a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS"&gt;average work
year&lt;/a&gt; of 1,789 hours.) We want to make our
proposal attractive to employers by not substantially changing the total number of hours
worked. A calendar with eight-day weeks would have about 43.5 work weeks per year
(excluding two weeks of vacation). So the average workday under this proposal would increase
from 7 hours to a few minutes over 8 hours. More reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;System&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Hours/week&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Weeks/year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Total hours&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Normal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,750&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Proposal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;43.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,750&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Previous attempts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the Romans at one point used the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar#Nundinal_cycle"&gt;Nundinal
Cycle&lt;/a&gt; until the introduction
of the Julian calendar. The &lt;em&gt;nundinum&lt;/em&gt; ("market day", yes, please attempt to use that in context
tomorrow) was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the day when city people would buy their eight days' worth of groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a typical TJ's run to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more or less &lt;a href="http://www.theeightdayweek.com/"&gt;crazy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogs.mentor.com/colinwalls/blog/2009/06/25/the-8-day-week/"&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt; have also been
made in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Problems, duh&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously it is far-fetched to believe that anyone would actually overhaul the calendar to
accommodate eight-day weeks. In one sense, it wouldn't make that much of a difference --
January 9 would stay January 9, a year would have the same number of months, and a month
would have the same number of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, maybe under my proposal a November beginning on a Friday or Saturday wouldn't have a
Thanksgiving. Sure, maybe every piece of software to ever use a date would have to be
patched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But think about those long weekends...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Try it out&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's nothing to stop a forward-thinking employer from simply scheduling their employees
5 days on and 3 days off under the existing calendar. A company with less need for constant
interface with the outside world (in terms of banks, markets, clients), such as a software
company doing initial product development, could give this a shot. Make sure to pay me
the fat consulting fees if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
