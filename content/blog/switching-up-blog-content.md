It's been over a year and a half since I've last posted here. I have some great ideas for really interesting posts to write, but somehow I never seem to find the time.

So I'll be switching the type of content I post in an effort to write more. I keep a file called `programming.md` on my computer in which I write down solutions to a lot of problems I encounter repeatedly. The goal with this file was to avoid searching for a problem, finding a StackOverflow page, finding a post that answers my question, and realizing that I had already upvoted that post at some unknown point in the past. How quickly this generation forgets.

In my posts, I'll try to expand this type of content to include more context about my problems. My hope is to be able to return to the posts myself in order to remember how to do something important, and also understand why those certain flags were added to a shell command, or why a custom function had to be written rather than using some library. Hope you enjoy.
