  <div>
      <p>If, as I investigated in a <a href="http://micahsmith.com/blog/2016/01/eight-days-a-week/">previous post</a>, you were down
with an eight-day week, then you were down with an idea that is possibly welfare improving.
Give yourself a pat on the back.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/decrgmayaeden/">Maya Eden</a> in a paper
elegantly titled <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3oVfDo6jiiTRDYwSGIzMEV3ekE/view"><em>The
Week</em></a>. Dr. Eden
presented her work at a New York Fed seminar yesterday on this issue near and dear to my
heart.</p>
<p>Eden's presentation of some of the background of the modern week included some joyfully
quirky tidbits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brunei <em>today</em> uses a 4-1-1-1 week (Friday and Sunday off) to accommodate the religious
    Muslim (day of rest on Friday) and Christian (Sunday) populations.</li>
<li>Beginning in 1929, the Soviets experimented with alternative weeks including a rotating
    4-1 (a different fifth of the population was off each of five days) and a coordinated
    5-1. A large part of this change was to diminish the influence of religion, of which
    the structure of the week originates. Eventually, they returned to a normal seven-day
    week with Sundays off. Historians use this latter fact to suggest that insubordination
    or noncompliance by religious citizens was not an insignificant problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The model</h2>
<p>In the model, labor productivity is a function of "fatigue" and "memory". Fatigue is
straightforward: people get tired. And when the are tired, they are less
productive and make more mistakes. This is the same issue that causes <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/four-day-workweek/396530/">The
Atlantic</a> or <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/09/working-hours">The
Economist</a> to publish
thinkpieces on or around labor day about reducing the work week.</p>
<p>While fatigue affects labor productivity in the short run, "memory" affects productivity in
the longer run. Memory is interpreted as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing_%28economics%29">learning by doing
capital</a> in which skills
sharpen through practice but depreciate through disuse. </p>
<ul>
<li>Vacation is investment in rest</li>
<li>Work is investment in memory</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After including a utility framework and calibrating the model, Eden makes some arguments
about productivity and social welfare. Right away, the modern week is swept into the gutter
-- for no vectors of admissible model parameters is the modern 5-2 week socially optimal.</p>
<p>Rather, as she told us,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is never a cycle with more than one vacation day that is optimal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intuition here is that pairs (or more) of non-contiguous vacation days per (seven-day)
week do just as much to restore "rest" as two contiguous vacation days but reduce the
depreciation in memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are productivity gains for having more Mondays per week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given Eden's calibration, the optimal <code>i-j</code> weeks (cycles of workdays followed by vacation
days) are either 2-1 or 3-1. Here, it is interesting note that both decreasing and
increasing the share of vacation relative to work days as compared to the current 5-2 week
can lead to welfare gains.</p>
<p><img alt="welfare table" src="http://micahsmith.com/images/eden_welfare_table.png" /></p>
<p>My beloved proposition for a 5-3 week did not meet with as much support as I had hoped. In
the table above, you can see that the 5-3 cell has some mass on welfare increasing but is
welfare reducing on average. The parameter calibration is an important factor here. (Though
hark, let welfare arguments not be the end of us.) </p>
<h2>Field research</h2>
<p>I asked a couple friends what they thought of the proposal for a 2-1 week. Universally
(N=3), they were disinterested. Concerns mounted around the shortened weekend, which would
increase the relative effect of <em>harumph</em> hangovers. With one day weekends, one additional
vacation day would be needed to increase the weekend to consecutive days off; and while two
additional vacation days would increase the weekend to four consecutive days off, this
wouldn't be any different than the current model. The fact that 2-1 weeks would lead to
around 17 extra days off per year was lost in the analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's like every weekend is a Sunday only, and Sundays are the worst weekend days!"</p>
<p>"Right, but the first day of every week is like a Thursday."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concerns about contiguous vacation time highlighted a missing piece of Eden's model --
no complementarity of contiguous vacation time. Even if these contiguous days are not used
for traveling, there seems to be something about being able to recover from a hangover and
not despair the coming of another week as a corporate drone.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The optimal arrangement of the week remains an open question. Eden's model could use some
additional features and improved calibration (with less of the "magic macro wand"). I'm
also interested in seeing some (not-really) serious proposals for how changes in the week
could be implemented and the costs thereof. Until then, let's get some ramen on Micahday and
catch up.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://micahsmith.com/blog/2016/02/vim-diff-dumb-paths/#vim-diff-dumb-paths">Using vimdiff with dumb paths</a></h2>

  <div>
      <p>I've been loving vimdiff as my git difftool for a while.</p>
<h2>Vimdiff and Matlab packages</h2>
<p>Vimdiff runs into some problems when working with Matlab code. Matlab considers
directories with names beginning with <code>+</code> as "packages", a natural way to organize
projects. However, this means that many paths relative to the git top-level directory begin
with <code>+</code>. Of course, this applies to any path beginning with a <code>+</code>, though this is otherwise an
uncommon naming convention.</p>
<p>Suppose that your project looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>+code/
  foo.m
  bar.m
</pre></div>


<p>You might want to use vim to diff your two files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vimdiff +code/foo.m +code/bar.m
</pre></div>


<p>But vim will tell you:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Error detected while processing command line:
E492: Not an editor comamnd: code/foo.m
E492: Not an editor comamnd: code/bar.m
</pre></div>


<p>What's going on? Vim interprets <code>+</code> as the start of a command-line argument (beyond
the typical <code>-</code>) and fails to find options/commands called <code>code/foo.m</code> and <code>code/bar.m</code>.</p>
<h2>The vimdiff solution</h2>
<p>Simply tell vimdiff somehow that the paths you are specifying are not options. (By the way,
note that vimdiff is pretty much just an alias for <code>vim -d</code>.)</p>
<p>We could prefix them with the current directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vimdiff ./+code/foo.m ./+code/bar.m
</pre></div>


<p>Better yet, note that the <code>--</code> option</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Denotes the end of the options.  Arguments after this will be handled as
a file  name. This can be used to edit a filename that starts with a '-'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, in our case, to edit a filename that starts with a <code>+</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vimdiff -- +code/foo.m +code/bar.m
</pre></div>


<h2>Bringing git into the picture</h2>
<p>We now update <code>+code/foo.m</code> and want to compare to the previous commit. Using git's
<code>difftool</code> command, we diff all modified git-tracked files using a tool of our choice:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git difftool --tool=vimdiff
</pre></div>


<p>Unfortunately, we run into the same problem as before.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;/private/var/folders/7v/cjvpqzt57c5fsb7qvsjmm5sw0000gn/T/7i6IKG_foo.m&quot; [readonly] 1L, 6C
Error detected while processing command line:
E492: Not an editor comamnd: code/foo.m
</pre></div>


<p>Since you haven't specified the file names yourself, you can't use either of the solutions
from the previous section!</p>
<h2>The git solution</h2>
<p>Git is basically writing the "before" state of the file to a temporary location and invoking
a typical vimdiff command. If we can modify this command, we can use one of our solutions
above.</p>
<p>One possibility is to set git's <code>difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd</code> config option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool. The specified command is evaluated in
shell with the following variables available: LOCAL is set to the name of the temporary file
containing the contents of the diff pre-image and REMOTE is set to the name of the temporary
file containing the contents of the diff post-image.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can do</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">git config --global difftool.vimdiff.cmd &#39;vimdiff -- </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">LOCAL</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">REMOTE</span><span class="x">&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That'll do it. While you're at it, why not update your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> with the following handy
diff-related settings:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[alias]</span>
    <span class="na">d</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">difftool</span>
<span class="k">[diff]</span>
    <span class="na">tool</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">vimdiff</span>
<span class="k">[difftool]</span>
    <span class="na">prompt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">false</span>
<span class="k">[difftool &quot;vimdiff&quot;]</span>
    <span class="na">cmd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">vimdiff -- $LOCAL $REMOTE</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Most people will likely never come across this problem: none of their paths are this crazy,
they use a different (read: graphical) difftool, they even use an external diff wrapper.
But this simple solution is all I need.</p>

      <p>Goldman literally has a vault full of ice cubes.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure if I had imagined this fun fact or not, but sure enough, Goldman's FiDi
headquarters is literally air conditioned in hot weather by the melting of massive ice
blocks in their basement.</p>
<p>According <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303828304575180581255747658">to the
WSJ</a>, which covers
such fun topics,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basement houses 92 storage tanks that hold 1.7 million pounds of ice made each night
when electricity rates are lower than during daytime hours. Air cooled by the melting ice
circulates throughout the building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would only fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool one third of the way.</p>
<p>Without knowing anything about the economics of air conditioning, this sounds at first like
nothing more than a gimmick. But
<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/30/news/companies/new-york-ice-cooling/">apparently</a>,
the system can be as much as 40 percent cheaper compared to traditional methods. The system,
called <em>thermal storage</em>, freezes the water into ice at night to take advantage of lower
electricity costs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It requires about 150 to 400 pounds of ice to cool down a person in an office building
every day," said Mark MacCracken, chief executive of Calmac.</p>

      <p>What would you give up for a three-day weekend?</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>How great are three-day weekends? For me, at least, they recall the days in undergrad in
which Thursday at 2pm was the end of the work week. The rejuvenation of those three-day
weekends is certainly a step above the normal weekend of the 21st century corporate drone.</p>
<p>If only we could do something about our real-life weekends...</p>
<h2>The proposal</h2>
<p>With that in mind, <strong>I propose a three-day weekend for all workers</strong>. Now hang with me here.</p>
<p>No employer would be happy to just give all of their employees Friday off each week - an
extra 52 vacation days! They might be open to weekly "flex days", with working hours
Monday-Thursday extended from 7 to 8.75 hours per day. This arrangement might be too much
for some workers but is not altogether unreasonable.</p>
<p>There are two balancing incentives:
- employees' desire for longer contiguous time off
- employers' desire for a minimum amount of hours worked by employees</p>
<p>(Though on the latter point, it is not clear that this is the best proxy for productive
output.)</p>
<h3>Micahday</h3>
<p>I propose <strong>an eighth day of the week</strong>, which we can tentatively name "Micahday."
(Alternate names are welcome.) Micahday would be inserted between Saturday and Sunday. The
key: <span class="math">\(\frac{4}{7}&lt;\frac{5}{8}&lt;\frac{5}{7}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We maintain our 5-day work week, and add a full, luxurious 3-day weekend. Fly, fool --
travel every weekend if you want to!</p>
<h3>Hours worked</h3>
<p>Assume a typical US employee works 35 hours/week for 50 weeks/year for a total of 1,750 hours. (This roughly
corresponds to the actual <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t18.htm">average work
week</a> of 34.5 hours and actual <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS">average work
year</a> of 1,789 hours.) We want to make our
proposal attractive to employers by not substantially changing the total number of hours
worked. A calendar with eight-day weeks would have about 43.5 work weeks per year
(excluding two weeks of vacation). So the average workday under this proposal would increase
from 7 hours to a few minutes over 8 hours. More reasonable.</p>

<h3>Previous attempts</h3>
<p>Apparently the Romans at one point used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar#Nundinal_cycle">Nundinal
Cycle</a> until the introduction
of the Julian calendar. The <em>nundinum</em> ("market day", yes, please attempt to use that in context
tomorrow) was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the day when city people would buy their eight days' worth of groceries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a typical TJ's run to me.</p>
<p>Some more or less <a href="http://www.theeightdayweek.com/">crazy</a>
<a href="https://blogs.mentor.com/colinwalls/blog/2009/06/25/the-8-day-week/">attempts</a> have also been
made in the modern era.</p>
<h2>Problems, duh</h2>
<p>Obviously it is far-fetched to believe that anyone would actually overhaul the calendar to
accommodate eight-day weeks. In one sense, it wouldn't make that much of a difference --
January 9 would stay January 9, a year would have the same number of months, and a month
would have the same number of days.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe under my proposal a November beginning on a Friday or Saturday wouldn't have a
Thanksgiving. Sure, maybe every piece of software to ever use a date would have to be
patched.</p>
<p>But think about those long weekends...</p>
<h2>Try it out</h2>
<p>There's nothing to stop a forward-thinking employer from simply scheduling their employees
5 days on and 3 days off under the existing calendar. A company with less need for constant
interface with the outside world (in terms of banks, markets, clients), such as a software
company doing initial product development, could give this a shot. Make sure to pay me
the fat consulting fees if you do.</p>
