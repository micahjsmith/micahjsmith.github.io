I am a first year PhD student in computer science at MIT. I work with Dr. Kalyan
Veeramachaneni in the [Data To AI group](http://dai.lids.mit.edu).

I'm interested in machine learning, data science, software engineering, espresso,
public transit, crosswords, BBQ, sports, and more. One of my greatest fears in life is that
my fantasy football teams perform no better than random chance, but we'll see about that
now, won't we. I code in Julia, Matlab, Python, Bash, C/C++, Java, and R.
