I am a third year PhD student in Computer Science at MIT in the [Department of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu). I work with Dr. Kalyan
Veeramachaneni in the [Data To AI group](https://dai.lids.mit.edu) within the [Laboratory
for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu).

My research interests broadly focus on machine learning systems. How can we create systems
that enable people to do machine learning and data science more easily and more efficiently?
How can we make machine learning and data science more collaborative in nature? How can we
make these areas more accessible to other domain experts? How can we expose data science and
machine learning to the open-source development paradigm?

I'm interested in machine learning, data science, software engineering, open source, and
human-computer interaction... as well as  public transit, crosswords, BBQ, running,
basketball, house plants, reading, and more. One of my greatest fears in life is that my
fantasy football teams perform no better than random chance, but we'll see about that now,
won't we.

Everything on this site reflects my personal views only.
