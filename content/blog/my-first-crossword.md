I made my first crossword! This is something that I've been working on *very* intermittently
since 2011. Very intermittently, in the sense that I would make progress only when I was
flying across the country on college breaks and, with no any internet connection, sometimes
didn't have anything better to do.

Actually, this is my second puzzle, but my first one is pretty sloppy and I'd rather show
you this one. Maybe that one will see the light one day, maybe not.

This puzzle even has a theme of sorts. See if you can guess which are the theme clues. (I'm
sure you can.) I imagined this printing in the New York Times on Thanksgiving of some year
as I triumphantly waved drumsticks in the air and forced loved ones to solve it.

## Making the puzzle

It was surprisingly difficult to create the puzzle. I still haven't looked into the
process and resources that experienced creators use, though I'm sure these can ease the
process substantially. In my attempt, I created a 15 x 15 table in iWork Pages/MS Word and
shaded cells to achieve black squares. I would place my theme answers, then try to fill in
corners one at a time. Eventually, I would come to an impasse and have to backtrack, deleting
answers until a fill would be possible again.

At first, all answers came from my head. But if I can't solve every crossword, then surely the
set of answers I could think of was much smaller than those necessary to ensure a diverse
fill. I next resorted to using regex with `/usr/share/dict/words` (or larger variants). This
was an imperfect solution as dictionaries don't have nearly the phrases, abbreviations,
acronyms, and proper nouns that make for an interesting puzzle. I finally used XWord Info's
excellent [clue finder](http://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder) and, in my most active phase, even
shelled out a small donation to get more access. (You may note that by this time I was not
necessarily flying on an airplane.)

This puzzle has seen many iterations. For each, I was my own worst critic, circling my
"groaners" even as friends who play-tested it didn't seem to mind. I minimized these in this
final version the best I can, though I'm sure [Rex Parker](http://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/)
would show no mercy on several of my answers.
