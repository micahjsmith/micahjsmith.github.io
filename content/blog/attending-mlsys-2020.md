Our demonstration of [Ballet](https://github.com/ballet/ballet) was recently accepted
at the Conference on ML and Systems (MLSys 2020). I will be attending the conference March
2-4 to present a live demonstration of our framework for real-time, collaborative feature
engineering. I'm looking forward to attending the conference, visiting Austin, TX, and
meeting some new folks in the ML systems area. Feel free to get in touch if you are also
attending and would like to meet!
