    <p>What would you give up for a three-day weekend?</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>How great are three-day weekends? For me, at least, they recall the days in undergrad in
which Thursday at 2pm was the end of the work week. The rejuvenation of those three-day
weekends is certainly a step above the normal weekend of the 21st century corporate drone.</p>
<p>If only we could do something about our real-life weekends...</p>
<h2>The proposal</h2>
<p>With that in mind, <strong>I propose a three-day weekend for all workers</strong>. Now hang with me here.</p>
<p>No employer would be happy to just give all of their employees Friday off each week - an
extra 52 vacation days! They might be open to weekly "flex days", with working hours
Monday-Thursday extended from 7 to 8.75 hours per day. This arrangement might be too much
for some workers but is not altogether unreasonable.</p>
<p>There are two balancing incentives:
- employees' desire for longer contiguous time off
- employers' desire for a minimum amount of hours worked by employees</p>
<p>(Though on the latter point, it is not clear that this is the best proxy for productive
output.)</p>
<h3>Micahday</h3>
<p>I propose <strong>an eighth day of the week</strong>, which we can tentatively name "Micahday."
(Alternate names are welcome.) Micahday would be inserted between Saturday and Sunday. The
key: <span class="math">\(\frac{4}{7}&lt;\frac{5}{8}&lt;\frac{5}{7}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We maintain our 5-day work week, and add a full, luxurious 3-day weekend. Fly, fool --
travel every weekend if you want to!</p>
<h3>Hours worked</h3>
<p>Assume a typical US employee works 35 hours/week for 50 weeks/year for a total of 1,750 hours. (This roughly
corresponds to the actual <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t18.htm">average work
week</a> of 34.5 hours and actual <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS">average work
year</a> of 1,789 hours.) We want to make our
proposal attractive to employers by not substantially changing the total number of hours
worked. A calendar with eight-day weeks would have about 43.5 work weeks per year
(excluding two weeks of vacation). So the average workday under this proposal would increase
from 7 hours to a few minutes over 8 hours. More reasonable.</p>

<h3>Previous attempts</h3>
<p>Apparently the Romans at one point used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar#Nundinal_cycle">Nundinal
Cycle</a> until the introduction
of the Julian calendar. The <em>nundinum</em> ("market day", yes, please attempt to use that in context
tomorrow) was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the day when city people would buy their eight days' worth of groceries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a typical TJ's run to me.</p>
<p>Some more or less <a href="http://www.theeightdayweek.com/">crazy</a>
<a href="https://blogs.mentor.com/colinwalls/blog/2009/06/25/the-8-day-week/">attempts</a> have also been
made in the modern era.</p>
<h2>Problems, duh</h2>
<p>Obviously it is far-fetched to believe that anyone would actually overhaul the calendar to
accommodate eight-day weeks. In one sense, it wouldn't make that much of a difference --
January 9 would stay January 9, a year would have the same number of months, and a month
would have the same number of days.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe under my proposal a November beginning on a Friday or Saturday wouldn't have a
Thanksgiving. Sure, maybe every piece of software to ever use a date would have to be
patched.</p>
<p>But think about those long weekends...</p>
<h2>Try it out</h2>
<p>There's nothing to stop a forward-thinking employer from simply scheduling their employees
5 days on and 3 days off under the existing calendar. A company with less need for constant
interface with the outside world (in terms of banks, markets, clients), such as a software
company doing initial product development, could give this a shot. Make sure to pay me
the fat consulting fees if you do.</p>
