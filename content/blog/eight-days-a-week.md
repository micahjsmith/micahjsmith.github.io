Summary: What would you give up for a three-day weekend?

# The problem

How great are three-day weekends? For me, at least, they recall the days in undergrad in
which Thursday at 2pm was the end of the work week. The rejuvenation of those three-day
weekends is certainly a step above the normal weekend of the 21st century corporate drone.

If only we could do something about our real-life weekends...

# The proposal

With that in mind, **I propose a three-day weekend for all workers**. Now hang with me here.

No employer would be happy to just give all of their employees Friday off each week - an
extra 52 vacation days! They might be open to weekly "flex days", with working hours
Monday-Thursday extended from 7 to 8.75 hours per day. This arrangement might be too much
for some workers but is not altogether unreasonable.

There are two balancing incentives:
- employees' desire for longer contiguous time off
- employers' desire for a minimum amount of hours worked by employees

(Though on the latter point, it is not clear that this is the best proxy for productive
output.)

### Micahday

I propose **an eighth day of the week**, which we can tentatively name "Micahday."
(Alternate names are welcome.) Micahday would be inserted between Saturday and Sunday. The
key: $\frac{4}{7}<\frac{5}{8}<\frac{5}{7}$.

We maintain our 5-day work week, and add a full, luxurious 3-day weekend. Fly, fool --
travel every weekend if you want to!

### Hours worked

Assume a typical US employee works 35 hours/week for 50 weeks/year for a total of 1,750 hours. (This roughly
corresponds to the actual [average work
week](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t18.htm) of 34.5 hours and actual [average work
year](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS) of 1,789 hours.) We want to make our
proposal attractive to employers by not substantially changing the total number of hours
worked. A calendar with eight-day weeks would have about 43.5 work weeks per year
(excluding two weeks of vacation). So the average workday under this proposal would increase
from 7 hours to a few minutes over 8 hours. More reasonable.

System   | Hours/week | Weeks/year | Total hours
------   | ---------- | ---------- | -----------
Normal   | 35         | 50         | 1,750
Proposal | 40         | 43.5       | 1,750

### Previous attempts

Apparently the Romans at one point used the [Nundinal
Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar#Nundinal_cycle) until the introduction
of the Julian calendar. The *nundinum* ("market day", yes, please attempt to use that in context
tomorrow) was
> the day when city people would buy their eight days' worth of groceries.

Sounds like a typical TJ's run to me.

Some more or less [crazy](http://www.theeightdayweek.com/)
[attempts](https://blogs.mentor.com/colinwalls/blog/2009/06/25/the-8-day-week/) have also been
made in the modern era.

# Problems, duh

Obviously it is far-fetched to believe that anyone would actually overhaul the calendar to
accommodate eight-day weeks. In one sense, it wouldn't make that much of a difference --
January 9 would stay January 9, a year would have the same number of months, and a month
would have the same number of years.

Sure, maybe under my proposal a November beginning on a Friday or Saturday wouldn't have a
Thanksgiving. Sure, maybe every piece of software to ever use a date would have to be
patched.

But think about those long weekends...

# Try it out

There's nothing to stop a forward-thinking employer from simply scheduling their employees
5 days on and 3 days off under the existing calendar. A company with less need for constant
interface with the outside world (in terms of banks, markets, clients), such as a software
company doing initial product development, could give this a shot. Make sure to pay me
the fat consulting fees if you do.
