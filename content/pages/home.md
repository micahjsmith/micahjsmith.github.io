I am a recent graduate of Columbia University, now living in historic Little Italy and
drinking large quantities of espresso. I currently work as a Research Analyst at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. I'm interested in machine learning, data analysis, security,
cryptography, and policy.

I like espresso (see above), public transit, crosswords, BBQ, and sports. One of my greatest
fears in life is that my fantasy football team performs no better than random chance, but
we'll see about that now, won't we. I code in Julia, Matlab, Python, Bash, C/C++, Java, and
R.
