Summary: What will you give up for a three-day weekend?
Status: draft

How great are three-day weekends? For me, at least, they recall the days in
undergrad in which Thursday at 2pm was the end of the work week. The
rejuvenation of those three-day weekends is certainly a step above the normal
weekend of the normal office worker.

Based on increasing demand for flexible working arrangements in recent years,
some employers offer biweekly "flex days": a Friday off every other week in
exchange for a longer work day. In some technology companies, unlimited paid
vacation is offered and workers are *required* to use a minimum number of
vacation days each year. It seems clear intuitively, at least, that overworked
employees are less productive.

With that in mind, I propose a three-day weekend for all workers. Now hang with me
here.

It seems unlikely that employers would be happy to just give all of their
employees Friday off each week - that would correspond to 52 extra vacation
days! They might be interested in "weekly flex days", with normal working hours
extended from 8 to 10 hours per day. But this arrangement may not even be a
quality of life improvement for employees.

There are two balancing incentives:
- employees' desire for longer contiguous time off
- employers' desire for a minimum amount of hours worked by employees

Though on the latter point, it is not clear that this is the best proxy for
productive output.

A Friday off each week is prohibitive because it requires prohibitively longer
normal workdays. The difference between 5/7 and 4/7 is too much to resolve.

I propose an eighth day of the week, which we can tentatively name "Micahday." (Better
suggestions are welcome.) Micahday would be inserted between Saturday and Sunday.

Now, we
have a full 5-day work week, as before, and
